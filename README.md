# Psychic-Game

## Brain is Brewin'
1. Key events to listen for the letters players type
2. Display game instrctions, wins, and number of times users guess letters correctly. The word chosen from an array must be first shown as underscores.
3. As users guess the correct letters, reveal them letter-by-letter.
4. Have letters already guessed displayed in a div and not valid upon another key event
5. After the user wins/loses the game, they should automatically choose another word and make the user play it.

### Bonuses
* play a sound or song when the user guesses their word correctly
* write some stylish CSS to make a design that fits the game theme
* Save your whole game and it's properties as an object? Organize your game code as an object if possible (except for the key events)
* save any of the game's functions as methods, and call them underneath the object declarations using event listeners
* place my global variables and functions above my object
  * global variables, then objects, then calls

Break the app down into tiny, manageable fragments. This will make the coding process much less frustrating. Learn the ability to solve a large problem by treating it as a set of smaller ones. So split the whole game into many distinct, pseudocoded problems. Focus on the smaller problems, solve it, then move onto another. Always commit work and back it up with Github pushes. Avoid losing hours of my work because I didn't push to GitHub every half hour or so. 

Use the console as a way to debug and troubleshooting problems. A more powerful alternative is to experiment with the [Chrome Devtools Debugger](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/)
